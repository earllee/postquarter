# PostQuarter

PostQuarter is a web application with a text messaging service, iOS application, and Apple Watch application. It enables coaches and athletes to organize practices and training as well as capture as much data as is relevant to them for analysis and development of better training programs. It provides a cutting edge by moving from qualitative to quantitative assessment and judgement of athletes' training.

PostQuarter aims to solve the problem of near-blind decision making in competitive sports when it comes to athletic performance.
